/* Bad word catcher with loops

 

For the purposes of this exercise, bad words are: clear, water, tires.

Create an application that:

Takes input from a user using a simple text input field.
Splits the string on spaces
Loops through  the array looking for bad words in the array
Adds 1 to a tally count when a bad word is found
Outputs to the document
If any bad words were found (found / not found)
How many bad words, in total, were found
Clears out the text field so the user can input a new string
 

For example, if the user input "clear water is clear", there are 3 bad words in the string. */

//plan

/*
//html
input field
button
div for the cuss count
div for found.

//js

split(" ") to split the string into an array.

scan the array for for bad words by setting a varriable for each.



for(let i =0; i<arrayName.length; i==){

if(arrayName[i]==findKeyword){console.log("found keyword")}  should be used to check for the words.
'everytime it is true, add one. if count is > 0 then print out "found"
