//----------------------------1 - Data-driven display w/ function-----------------------------------//

//Make an object with all the properties for a graphic on the screen
// - width, height, color, position. These numbers could represent positions of wheels,
// eye colors, or rainbow lengths. In your create or draw function draw that object to the screen using the 
//data in your object - using a series of fill commands, draw commands, and whatever else you need to draw the object to the screen.
// Try to not hard-code any numbers in the drawing commands - only use the object properties to set sizes, colors, or position.

//The, create a function that takes one argument and draws an object to the screen using that object argument. 
//Pass your object to that function as an argument, and have the function draw the object to the screen. An example function is below:

//function drawRocket( rocketObject ) {
  //    rect(rocketObject.x, rocketObject.y, rocketObject.width, rocketObject.height);
//}

//--------------------------------------2 - Reverse Tennis (?)-----------------------//

//Create two objects with properties for the x, y, width,
// and height for a 'tall' rectangle. Set their 'x' properties so that when drawn, 
//one will appear on the left side of the composition, and the other on the right side.


//In the draw function,

//draw both of the rectangles in the objects to the screen, based on their properties
//if the up key is pressed, make the first object move up, and the second object move down
//if the down key is pressed, make the first object move down, and the other object move up 

//sample code

// if (keyIsDown(UP_ARROW)) {
    //change properties
//}

//---------------3 - Bouncing Ball / World Wrap Refactor----------------------------------//

//Take your ball bounce or world wrap assignment and recode it using an object
// to store the ball's size, color, and velocity. No global variables or hardcoded values 
//should be used in your update function.
