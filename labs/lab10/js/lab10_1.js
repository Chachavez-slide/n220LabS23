/*
Create an application with three grey, square divs, in a row. 
They should be 200px by 200px, and all floated left. Give them a margin of 5px.

Using only one event handler, write event listeners to respond to a click on each element.
 Each element should change to a different color: one red, one green, and one blue.
  Use a data attribute on the elements to store the color to be changed to.

The result, after clicking on the first and third, should look something like this:
*/

//plans 

//html

//create 3 divs 
//classes: div1, div2, div3
// set up classes to have even length sides 

//java use an even listener onClick.
//when clicked change div 1 to #ff0000
//div 2 to #00ff00
//div 3 to #0000ff

// change each class atttribute when div clicked.
