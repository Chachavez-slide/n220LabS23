An application with 3 buttons that ask questions. 
For instance, they might ask "What is the capital of Indiana?".
 Each button should have a data-answer attribute that lists the answer.
When a button is clicked, display the answer to the button's question in a div.
 Use only one function, and that function must make use of the button's data-attribute.
